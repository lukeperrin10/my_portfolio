      <p>
        I'm Luke, I am a Swedish guy that used to be Welsh. I moved to Sweden in
        2010 and haven't really looked back. I live in Stockholm with my partner
        and our young son. Recently I decided on a career change and wanted to
        move in to something that has always been an interes, working with
        computers. Now with no experience or knowledge in coding bar a some half
        worked through Udemy courses I signed up for a Fullstack devleoper
        course at Craft Academy. And started my three month intensive journey to
        become a web developer.
